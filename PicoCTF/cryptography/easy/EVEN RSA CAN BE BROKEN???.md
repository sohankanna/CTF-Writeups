In RSA encryption, **`e`**, **`n`**, and **`c`** are essential public components used to lock a message.

Think of it like sending a secret message using a public lockbox. ðŸ“¦

***

#### n (The Modulus): The Lockbox

**`n`** is a very large public number. It acts as the **lockbox** itself. It's created by multiplying two secret, large prime numbers. Everyone can see and use this lockbox, but only the intended recipient has the key to open it.

***

#### e (The Public Exponent): The "Lock" Button

**`e`** is another public number that acts as the **"lock" button** on the box. Anyone can take a message, place it inside the lockbox (`n`), and press this button (`e`) to securely lock it. A common choice for `e` is 65537 because it makes the locking process fast.

***

#### c (The Ciphertext): The Locked Message

**`c`** is the **scrambled, unreadable message** after it has been locked. This is what's actually sent over the internet. It's calculated by taking the original message (`m`) and applying the public values in a formula:

$$c = m^e \pmod{n}$$

To anyone else, `c` looks like random numbers. Only the person with the corresponding private key can unlock the box and reveal the original message `m`. 

To decrypt this message we can use online tools, one such is https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher
