## Analysis and solution 

We are given the following cipher text 

```text
cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_hyLicInt}
```

The flag is encrypted with the ROT13 Cipher. This can be made clear by the image as shown

To decrypt this we can use online tools, one such is https://www.dcode.fr/rot-13-cipher

Just input the ciphertext and click on decrypt to get the flag
