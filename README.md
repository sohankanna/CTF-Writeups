Welcome to my collection of cybersecurity-writeups writeups. This repository contains solutions and explanations for challenges from various platforms, organized by platform and event.

## Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each CTF platform, with subfolders for specific events or challenges:

- **PicoCTF/**: Writeups for PicoCTF challenges, organized by year or challenge name.

- **HackTheBox/**: Writeups for HackTheBox challenges, grouped by category (e.g., Web, Pwn).

## How to Navigate
Each folder contains:
- `writeup.md`: Detailed explanation of the challenge and solution.
