# CTF Writeups
Welcome to my collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups. This repository contains solutions and explanations for challenges from various CTF platforms, organized by platform and event.

## Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each CTF platform, with subfolders for specific events or challenges:

- **PicoCTF/**: Writeups for PicoCTF challenges, organized by year or challenge name.
- **TryHackMe/**: Writeups for TryHackMe rooms, organized by room name.
- **HackTheBox/**: Writeups for HackTheBox challenges, grouped by category (e.g., Web, Pwn).
- **Others/**: Writeups for miscellaneous CTFs (e.g., OverTheWire, CTFtime events).
